# FRT_project_Travel_Bot
The majority of people like to travel, but "WHERE?" is always the most difficult question. Most of the time indecisiveness leads to the cancelation of plans. In this case, "Travel Bot" works wonders. Deploying an Azure chat Bot that will be intelligent enough to provide appropriate and clear suggestions for traveling more focused on different regions of India. It can help in quick decision-making when deciding on a place to travel in India. In future scope, this Travel Azure Bot can then be additionally trained and can be connected to the databases of the live travel lists and booking sites. This will assist the Bot to provide more precise and Real-time answers. I have used QnA Maker to generate a basic KB that is capable of answering and suggesting places along with links to appropriate websites that will give more information about the respective place. Then after, I created Azure Web Bot with the KB created. After creating My bot successfully, I deploy the bot on my website that I created on VS code using the secret key. I have hosted my website using Azure Static website.
